## Setup

1. Clone repo `git clone <repo_link> kofoundme` <!-- TODO -->
2. Verify npm global installation by running `npm install npm -g`
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install` from the **kofoundme** directory/folder
4. Start app locally by running `npm run dev` from the **kofoundme** directory/folder

### Hints

1. Get Started: `npm install`
2. Install additional dependencies: `npm install <dependency-name>`
3. Run tests: `npm run test`
4. Run tests in watch mode: `npm run test:watch`
5. Run tests with test coverage info: `npm run test:cover`
6. Check the codebase for proper syntax and formatting compliance: `npm run lint`
7. Check the codebase for lint and test errors: `npm run check`
8. Build app for deployment: `npm run build`
9. Run app from build: `npm start`
10. Run app in local dev mode: `npm run dev`.

- This first runs `npm run check` to check codebase for lint and test errors. If any are found, an npm error is thrown and the app exits with an error code
